# scheme
CS61A project

This is a project that I implemented for my CS61A class.

In this project my Rahul Chekuri and I developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. During this process we got a better understanding of of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. We also implemented some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language.

DISCLAIMER: The project uses several files, but we have only made changess to scheme.py, scheme_reader.py, questions.scm, and tests.scm, the rest of the files contain skeleton code written by the course staff.
